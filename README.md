  <p> The new zoo is headlining these 5 new superstars: Gorillas, Tigers, Alligators, Racoons and a Lynx.
My job was just to build a simple blog to communicate how these animals, where they live also who they are.
The zoo will do imnse detail on their habitats like a swamp and a very cold snow filled terrain for the Canadian Royalty the lynx.
I advise you to come and check out the blog then head to the zoo!</p>
